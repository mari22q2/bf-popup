â€¢ I have this code on github, and the openPopup. js is available through https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mari22q2/bf-popup/openPopup.js\
I use it for
adding popups to
clients websites, by just inserting the snippet.\
However - I now want to enable my clients to do it themselves. And it has to be very easy, as they are typically not tech savvy.\
That's why I to begin with have to bulletproof my code, and maybe make the header snippet easier to understand (by using data attributes).\
Please start my reading through all my files in this repo, and understanding how it works. \
Then I need your help to create a simple HTML page hosted on github pages, which a client can access and then build their own popup script.
1. There should be a function to insert their website URL and pull the existing configuration (if they are coming back and want to update their configuration).\
2. They should be able to change a global color variable, and then add all the popups they want. \
2.1 For each popup they should enter: Form URL \
2.2 And for each popup they have to select how the popup shall be triggered. It can be through either inputting 1. a specfic .class or #id for the popup. 2. A specific url page
(where all buttons should open this popup), or 3. a popup which contains some specific text.\
Please make it all very simple, as this shouldn't be overcomplicated.\
Have you understood your task?
